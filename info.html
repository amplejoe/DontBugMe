    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>
    This game is the result of the <a target="_blank" href="http://itec.aau.at/gamejam/">2nd Klagenfurt Game Jam 2015 </a>
    (<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/klujam?src=hash/">#klujam</a>). It's a 1 Keyboard Multiplayer
    Game that features energetic bugs, that race each other on a single screen. The Bugs are named and modelled after
    Austrian skiing athletes - Andi Goldi, Marcel Hirschi, Raini Schöni & Marlies Schildi. They are controlled by up to
    4 players with a single key for each. These keys are randomized constantly so the players have to be quick
    to find their currently assigned one on the keyboard - Don't bug your opponents!
    Pressing the right keys gives the bugs an energy boost, failing to do so results in the bug falling
    behind and eventually below the screen, which means the game is lost for that player. The last
    bug on the screen wins.
    </p>

    <h1>Controls</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>
            ENTER/SPACEBAR advances between title & menu screens.
        </li>
        <li>
            Clicking on 'Info' or pressing 'I' on the Title Screen opens this Information page.
        </li>
        <li>
            Use 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' to control your bug.
        </li>
        <li>
            Before the race starts (after go) all players MUST at least once have pressed their corresponding keys.
            In this phase the keys change after a certain interval - so be quick to find your button!
        </li>
        <li>
            On the Game Over Screen you can navigate with the arrow keys (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN). You can add
            your name to the high score (note: currently local browser storage only!) by typing in several characters (at least 3),
            selecting the green check mark with the LEFT/RIGHT arrow button and press ENTER/SPACEBAR to confirm. An entry
            will be cancelled by selecting the X mark respectively. After you have made your choice you can choose to display
            the current high score in a new tab by selecting 'Show Highscore' using the UP/DOWN arrows or select a 'New Game'
            once again pressing ENTER/SPACEBAR.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Technology</h1>
    <p>
    The Game was written in <a target="_blank" href="https://phaser.io/">Phaser</a>, a HTML 5 media framework based on JavaScript.
    IDEAs <a target="_blank" href="https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/">WebStorm</a> was used as an IDE and all Classes were written in
    <a target="_blank" href="http://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a>, which is a free open source programming language developed
    and maintained by Microsoft. Typescript is a superset of JavaScript and aims at making JavaScript programming
    more object-oriented.
    </p>

    <h1>Known Issues</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Before the race sometimes not all keys pressed are recognized simultaneously (only individually).
            This is due to the fact that apparently, as pointed out in the
            <a target="_blank" href="http://phaser.io/docs/Phaser.Keyboard.html/Phaser.Keyboard.html">
            Phaser documentation</a>, many keyboards are unable to process certain combinations of keys
            due to hardware limitations known as ghosting.
            Please restart the game in this case (Refresh Browser with F5).
        </li>
        <li>
            Firefox and Opera encounter sound problems.
        </li>
    </ul>
